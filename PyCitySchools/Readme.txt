In this challenge, they provide the students and the schools' files with information. I have to create the district's key metrics in a data frame and provide summaries of key metrics about each school. 
The main objectify of this Panda challenge is to summarize the analysis and draw two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations. After finding more information about the district's summary and also the school's summary by following the given instructions (please find more information in the folder). 

I started by checking the two given files' looks using different functionality, such as shape and type, just to get an idea.

After, I managed to merge two files and called df_combined. With df_combined, I managed to find out the needed information such as the total number of schools, total students, total budget, different averages, etc.

I managed to provide district, and school summaries as well as different schools' performance with different subject scores by grades, school size, etc.
